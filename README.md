# PythOT
A Python implementation of Optimality Theory (Prince &amp; Smolensky 1993)

## Usage
The code is contained in `Optimality.ipynb`, which should be self-contained and runnable. Aside from the Jupyter framework, the program requires `python3` with the `numpy` and `requests` libraries:

```
$ pip install numpy requests
```
